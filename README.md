=====

Based on Firebase, I start this web application. Firebase is 'A scalable real-time backend for your web app', yes, it is!
You can check it out at http://www.firebase.com/.
This app is now quite simple. You just write down your idea and submit it, and then, who are just online can see your 
update. They can 'up' or 'down'(says, for or against) your idea to show their opinions. I just think that, many times 
I think of something interesting or valuable and I just purely wanna share it. So, just share it.
